ORDER
zones->blocks->sectors->MBR/partition
Sectors:
1. Boot Sector
first 1K block => contains master boot record (MBR) & partition table (if exists)
Partitions and Subpartitions
-partition table is located at address = 0x1BE on disk
-partition type for minix: 0x81
-Must check for validity before proceeding=> signature : 0x55 in byte 510 & 0xAA in 
byte 511

2. Superblock
Next 1K Block after boot sector
-zonesize = blocksize << log_zone_size

FILES: collection of zones indexed by inode
